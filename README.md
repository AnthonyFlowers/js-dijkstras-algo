# js-dijkstras-algo

## A "simple" implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm

- edge.ts represents an edge on the graph. Holds two points and the distance between them
- graph.ts handles the graph information like vertices and edges between them
- GraphDisplay.vue handles the page display and interface between the user and the graph.

Created using: Vue 3, TypeScript and Vite

## Vue 3

Used to display the page/graph and handle interactions between the user and the graph.

## TypeScript

Used for more strongly typed JavaScript

## Vite

Build tool used for a faster development
